Specific to each community’s vernacular and established without governance, the natural evolution of text messaging is an example of functional anarchy where each user writes as he or she sees fit, making up new idioms according to their needs. As a result, this inventive use of punctuation, alphabet, numbers and special characters has contributed to the creation of a living and ever-evolving language.</p>\n<p>The mutability of terms and the speed with which text messages are exchanged within this mode of communication, contrast with practice of ceramics. Marked by the slowness of both the process and the acquisition of the necessary skills to produce a work of art, this craft requires many hours of devotion to the development of a technical plan as to creative research. In this sense, it is based on commitment and a long-term vision and a determination to succeed despite recurring failures.</p>\n<p>Conversely, text messages are delivered in “real time” with little regard to form or typos, which are quickly rectified with generally few consequences. One of the effects of this practice is that it disrupts our chronological perception of time as the message thread is often interrupted, amassed, forgotten or repeated through multiple conversations.</p>\n<p>These contrasting factors have motivated me to study this phenomenon through the tools and techniques specific to my craft. In this way, I chose to use clay to create the expression “T OU ?” and to install this text message in public places. “T OU ?” suggests a response within a spatiotemporal logic, but when made of ceramics and placed out of context, it brings about a new dilemma for its viewer—namely what are the impacts of these modes of communication on our human relationships.</p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"one_image_row","size":"5","image":"https://admin.pascalegirardin.art/app/uploads/2020/01/t-ou_07.jpg","align":"left"},{"acf_fc_layout":"one_image_row","size":"6","image":"https://admin.pascalegirardin.art/app/uploads/2020/01/t-ou_04.jpg","align":"right"}]},"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https://admin.pascalegirardin.art/wp-json/wp/v2/projects/224"}],"collection":[{"href":"https://admin.pascalegirardin.art/wp-json/wp/v2/projects"}],"about":[{"href":"https://admin.pascalegirardin.art/wp-json/wp/v2/types/project"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https://admin.pascalegirardin.art/wp-json/wp/v2/media/160"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https://admin.pascalegirardin.art/wp-json/wp/v2/media?parent=224"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https://admin.pascalegirardin.art/wp-json/wp/v2/categories?post=224"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https://api.w.org/{rel}","templated":true}]}},"featured_mediaID":160,"menus":[{"term_id":25,"name":"footer-en_CA","slug":"footer-en_ca","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":25,"taxonomy":"nav_menu","description":"","parent":0,"count":13,"filter":"raw","ID":25,"meta":{"links":{"collection":"https://admin.pascalegirardin.art/wp-json/wp-api-menus/v2/menus/","self":"https://admin.pascalegirardin.art/wp-json/wp-api-menus/v2/menus/25"}}},{"term_id":20,"name":"footer-fr_CA","slug":"footer-fr_ca","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":20,"taxonomy":"nav_menu","description":"","parent":0,"count":13,"filter":"raw","ID":20,"meta":{"links":{"collection":"https://admin.pascalegirardin.art/wp-json/wp-api-menus/v2/menus/","self":"https://admin.pascalegirardin.art/wp-json/wp-api-menus/v2/menus/20"}}},{"term_id":19,"name":"primary-en_CA","slug":"primary-en_ca","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":19,"taxonomy":"nav_menu","description":"","parent":0,"count":5,"filter":"raw","ID":19,"meta":{"links":{"collection":"https://admin.pascalegirardin.art/wp-json/wp-api-menus/v2/menus/","self":"https://admin.pascalegirardin.art/wp-json/wp-api-menus/v2/menus/19"}}},{"term_id":14,"name":"primary-fr_CA","slug":"primary-fr_ca","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":14,"taxonomy":"nav_menu","description":"","parent":0,"count":5,"filter":"raw","ID":14,"meta":{"links":{"collection":"https://admin.pascalegirardin.art/wp-json/wp-api-menus/v2/menus/","self":"https://admin.pascalegirardin.art/wp-json/wp-api-menus/v2/menus/14"}}}]},"__N_SSG":true}
