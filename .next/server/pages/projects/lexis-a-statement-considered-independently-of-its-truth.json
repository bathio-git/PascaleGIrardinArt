Part state of affairs, part retrospective, the two large-scale pieces presented at the gallery elaborate on these themes by way of visual artifacts created by each artist throughout the decade and “re-collected” for this show.</p>\n<p>Rosemary and Pascale met in the Laurentians when they left the city to concentrate on their artwork. A decade later both returned to urban life, prompting a series of dialogues upon the nexus of art, career and motherhood. Sorting through vast amounts of art products and by-products during the moves, the two women wondered how day-to-day activities of artists could be re-presented and given validity. <em>Lexis</em> was born of that conversation and represents a continuum from Mary Kelly’s attempt to document the minutiae of motherhood almost forty years ago.</p>\n<p>Rather than reading as a guided set of chronological works, the art pieces created use as medium various previously designed and used imagery and components. Balanced between haphazard selection, and artful coordination of juxtaposed elements, the end result reflects the random yet ordered nature of both the universe and the artists’ personal truths. Expanding on the notion of corpus these works allow the audience to experience the activity of art making and not just artist intention or biography.</p>\n<p>Rosemary’s UP mines the extensive database of imagery hidden within her hard drive—years and layers of 2D vector imagery and icons designed throughout her practice—to create a single large scale digital image. Steering away from the obligation towards beauty or story line, she moves towards the concept of state and being.</p>\n<p>Echoing this tableau is Pascale’s floor arrangement of ceramic pieces and remnants of architectural projects. Inspired by the art of mandala, Pascale charts the ground in a single image, bringing coherence to her various selves. From these myriad fragments, the whole person is expressed in SPHERE.</p>\n<p>By gathering scattered artifacts of everyday art and putting them together for display, these collages become the visual phraseology of over a decade’s worth of gestures, of doing and of executing. Traces and marks randomly left behind by the constant separation of art and living are brought together in a language that values the former without devaluing the latter. Thus the insignificant becomes both signified and timeless.</p>\n<p>Rosemary Arroyave started out as a modern dancer with the Desrosiers Dance Theatre of Toronto and her artwork is infused with a dancer’s knowledge of the body. Studies in studio arts and design initiated a fifteen-year practice as a graphic artist and designer. An early adopter of computer arts, her methodology jumps between electrically charged oil paintings to the seamless world of vector graphics. An acute and almost obsessive interest in drawing both on the computer and using traditional materials has built an extensive body of work which explores the synchronicity between the inner and outer, the seen and unseen, the implied and the said.</p>\n<p>Pascale Girardin bridges the gaps between craft, art and design, creating large-scale public artworks for luxury hotels and restaurants across the globe. Originally trained as a painter, Pascale eventually chose ceramics as a means of expression designing tableware and large scale murals and sculptures for high-end restaurants and hotels across the globe. Her carefully shaped sculptures have a quiet, tactile presence and her color palettes are often monochromatic, choosing instead to play with the effects of light and shadows. In this way Pascale celebrates the soft, malleable nature of the materials she chooses to work with.</p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"one_image_row","size":"5","image":"https://admin.pascalegirardin.art/app/uploads/2020/01/LEXIS_2011_Pascale_Girardin_6.jpg","align":"right"},{"acf_fc_layout":"one_image_row","size":"6","image":"https://admin.pascalegirardin.art/app/uploads/2020/01/LEXIS_2011_Pascale_Girardin_4.jpg","align":"left"},{"acf_fc_layout":"slider","images":[{"ID":146,"id":146,"title":"","filename":"LEXIS_2011_Pascale_Girardin_7.jpg","filesize":65617,"url":"https://admin.pascalegirardin.art/app/uploads/2020/01/LEXIS_2011_Pascale_Girardin_7.jpg","link":"https://admin.pascalegirardin.art/lexis_2011_pascale_girardin_7/","alt":"","author":"1","description":"","caption":"","name":"lexis_2011_pascale_girardin_7","status":"inherit","uploaded_to":0,"date":"2020-01-24
