Skills are acquired over time and as such, the production of a ceramic art piece implies that one dedicates as much time on technical planning as on creative research and in this sense, ceramic practice is a form of commitment.</p>\n<p><em>Intramuros</em> stems from conversations with my son and his friends on urban art and more particularly on the meaning of tags and graffiti and reflects a desire to further deepen my understanding of the significance that this discipline has for its practitioners and for the public. As a result, I set off to learn about an urban art history &#8211; from techniques and styles to the various schools of thought specific to this art form. As with contemporary art, status and recognition are dictated by specific criteria and are established by its members. In this way, factors such as visibility, location, risks incurred, the singularity and reputation of the writer contribute to the development of this community which, until very recently, has been marginalized.</p>\n<p>At first glance, ceramics and graffiti have little in common: aerosol paintings or collages are rapid techniques; they often have poor weather-resistance; they are vulnerable to other writers or to clean-up crews and they generally have a short life span. Nevertheless, they have some elements in common: repetitive and recursive gestures; preparation and planning of a piece and the need to exhibit works with a receptive audience. I have chosen to study this world through the lens of my craft using methods that are familiar to me in the hopes of developing a new perspective to this misunderstood artform and perhaps building bridges between these distinct communities. In this way, I have developed a series of low-reliefs that draw on the visual language of tags and &#8220;throw-ups&#8221;.</p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"one_image_row","size":"5","image":"https://admin.pascalegirardin.art/app/uploads/2020/01/6.Intramuros-I.jpg","align":"right"},{"acf_fc_layout":"slider","images":[{"ID":164,"id":164,"title":"Clay III","filename":"clay-5.jpg","filesize":1328355,"url":"https://admin.pascalegirardin.art/app/uploads/2020/01/clay-5.jpg","link":"https://admin.pascalegirardin.art/clay-5/","alt":"Clay III","author":"1","description":"","caption":"Bas-relief. 2009.<br/>Grès façonné, émaillé, troisième feu, 29 cm X 23 cm.","name":"clay-5","status":"inherit","uploaded_to":0,"date":"2020-01-24 17:43:13","modified":"2020-01-24 22:39:56","menu_order":0,"mime_type":"image/jpeg","type":"image","subtype":"jpeg","icon":"https://admin.pascalegirardin.art/wp/wp-includes/images/media/default.png","width":2000,"height":1500,"sizes":{"thumbnail":"https://admin.pascalegirardin.art/app/uploads/2020/01/clay-5-150x150.jpg","thumbnail-width":150,"thumbnail-height":150,"medium":"https://admin.pascalegirardin.art/app/uploads/2020/01/clay-5-300x225.jpg","medium-width":300,"medium-height":225,"medium_large":"https://admin.pascalegirardin.art/app/uploads/2020/01/clay-5-768x576.jpg","medium_large-width":768,"medium_large-height":576,"large":"https://admin.pascalegirardin.art/app/uploads/2020/01/clay-5-1024x768.jpg","large-width":1024,"large-height":768,"1536x1536":"https://admin.pascalegirardin.art/app/uploads/2020/01/clay-5-1536x1152.jpg","1536x1536-width":1536,"1536x1536-height":1152,"2048x2048":"https://admin.pascalegirardin.art/app/uploads/2020/01/clay-5.jpg","2048x2048-width":2000,"2048x2048-height":1500}},{"ID":81,"id":81,"title":"Clay I","filename":"2.P1070361-scaled.jpg","filesize":812022,"url":"https://admin.pascalegirardin.art/app/uploads/2020/01/2.P1070361-scaled.jpg","link":"https://admin.pascalegirardin.art/2-p1070361/","alt":"Clay I","author":"1","description":"","caption":"Bas-relief. 2009.<br/>Grès façonné et émaillé, 24 cm X 100 cm.","name":"2-p1070361","status":"inherit","uploaded_to":0,"date":"2020-01-24 17:23:44","modified":"2020-01-24 22:40:57","menu_order":0,"mime_type":"image/jpeg","type":"image","subtype":"jpeg","icon":"https://admin.pascalegirardin.art/wp/wp-includes/images/media/default.png","width":2560,"height":1979,"sizes":{"thumbnail":"https://admin.pascalegirardin.art/app/uploads/2020/01/2.P1070361-150x150.jpg","thumbnail-width":150,"thumbnail-height":150,"medium":"https://admin.pascalegirardin.art/app/uploads/2020/01/2.P1070361-300x232.jpg","medium-width":300,"medium-height":232,"medium_large":"https://admin.pascalegirardin.art/app/uploads/2020/01/2.P1070361-768x594.jpg","medium_large-width":768,"medium_large-height":594,"large":"https://admin.pascalegirardin.art/app/uploads/2020/01/2.P1070361-1024x791.jpg","large-width":1024,"large-height":791,"1536x1536":"https://admin.pascalegirardin.art/app/uploads/2020/01/2.P1070361-1536x1187.jpg","1536x1536-width":1536,"1536x1536-height":1187,"2048x2048":"https://admin.pascalegirardin.art/app/uploads/2020/01/2.P1070361-2048x1583.jpg","2048x2048-width":2048,"2048x2048-height":1583}},{"ID":88,"id":88,"title":"Clay II","filename":"4.P1070316-scaled.jpg","filesize":747584,"url":"https://admin.pascalegirardin.art/app/uploads/2020/01/4.P1070316-scaled.jpg","link":"https://admin.pascalegirardin.art/4-p1070316/","alt":"Clay II","author":"1","description":"","caption":"Installation. 2009.<br/>Grès extrudé, dimensions variables.","name":"4-p1070316","status":"inherit","uploaded_to":0,"date":"2020-01-24 17:23:56","modified":"2020-01-24 22:40:29","menu_order":0,"mime_type":"image/jpeg","type":"image","subtype":"jpeg","icon":"https://admin.pascalegirardin.art/wp/wp-includes/images/media/default.png","width":2560,"height":1379,"sizes":{"thumbnail":"https://admin.pascalegirardin.art/app/uploads/2020/01/4.P1070316-150x150.jpg","thumbnail-width":150,"thumbnail-height":150,"medium":"https://admin.pascalegirardin.art/app/uploads/2020/01/4.P1070316-300x162.jpg","medium-width":300,"medium-height":162,"medium_large":"https://admin.pascalegirardin.art/app/uploads/2020/01/4.P1070316-768x414.jpg","medium_large-width":768,"medium_large-height":414,"large":"https://admin.pascalegirardin.art/app/uploads/2020/01/4.P1070316-1024x552.jpg","large-width":1024,"large-height":552,"1536x1536":"https://admin.pascalegirardin.art/app/uploads/2020/01/4.P1070316-1536x828.jpg","1536x1536-width":1536,"1536x1536-height":828,"2048x2048":"https://admin.pascalegirardin.art/app/uploads/2020/01/4.P1070316-2048x1103.jpg","2048x2048-width":2048,"2048x2048-height":1103}}]},{"acf_fc_layout":"text","text_content":"<p>Far from the hostile environment where tags and graffiti are usually displayed, the gallery presentation of these similes raises the question of the artist&#8217;s role and need for recognition. Whereas the purpose of the tag is to mark the presence of its author in a given territory and to display her/his status, the notion of self-determination brings to light a fundamental issue within the contemporary art world, where status is &#8220;granted&#8221; to an artist (it would be unseemly and ill-advised to proclaim oneself king of one&#8217;s artist centre). This particular theme has prompted me to produce a series of low-reliefs of my initials &#8220;PG&#8221; aligned end to end horizontally along a wall and throw-ups using the aliases “Clay” and “Clayer”. The former evokes a graphic pattern similar to a mantra whose meaning, through the simple act of repeating, departs from its egocentric outset.</p>\n<p><em>Intramuros</em> draws a parallel between the institution of contemporary art and the marginalized practice of urban art. The series investigates the legitimacy of the act of creation and whether this mimetic approach can lead to a broader discussion on the subject with an audience that is informed or otherwise.</p>\n"}]},"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https://admin.pascalegirardin.art/wp-json/wp/v2/projects/223"}],"collection":[{"href":"https://admin.pascalegirardin.art/wp-json/wp/v2/projects"}],"about":[{"href":"https://admin.pascalegirardin.art/wp-json/wp/v2/types/project"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https://admin.pascalegirardin.art/wp-json/wp/v2/media/162"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https://admin.pascalegirardin.art/wp-json/wp/v2/media?parent=223"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https://admin.pascalegirardin.art/wp-json/wp/v2/categories?post=223"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https://api.w.org/{rel}","templated":true}]}},"featured_mediaID":162,"menus":[{"term_id":25,"name":"footer-en_CA","slug":"footer-en_ca","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":25,"taxonomy":"nav_menu","description":"","parent":0,"count":13,"filter":"raw","ID":25,"meta":{"links":{"collection":"https://admin.pascalegirardin.art/wp-json/wp-api-menus/v2/menus/","self":"https://admin.pascalegirardin.art/wp-json/wp-api-menus/v2/menus/25"}}},{"term_id":20,"name":"footer-fr_CA","slug":"footer-fr_ca","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":20,"taxonomy":"nav_menu","description":"","parent":0,"count":13,"filter":"raw","ID":20,"meta":{"links":{"collection":"https://admin.pascalegirardin.art/wp-json/wp-api-menus/v2/menus/","self":"https://admin.pascalegirardin.art/wp-json/wp-api-menus/v2/menus/20"}}},{"term_id":19,"name":"primary-en_CA","slug":"primary-en_ca","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":19,"taxonomy":"nav_menu","description":"","parent":0,"count":5,"filter":"raw","ID":19,"meta":{"links":{"collection":"https://admin.pascalegirardin.art/wp-json/wp-api-menus/v2/menus/","self":"https://admin.pascalegirardin.art/wp-json/wp-api-menus/v2/menus/19"}}},{"term_id":14,"name":"primary-fr_CA","slug":"primary-fr_ca","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":14,"taxonomy":"nav_menu","description":"","parent":0,"count":5,"filter":"raw","ID":14,"meta":{"links":{"collection":"https://admin.pascalegirardin.art/wp-json/wp-api-menus/v2/menus/","self":"https://admin.pascalegirardin.art/wp-json/wp-api-menus/v2/menus/14"}}}]},"__N_SSG":true}
